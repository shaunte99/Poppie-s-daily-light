  <p class="message" id="love-note">
   Hey Ms Sunshine, <br/><br/>
The Sabbath is a holy reminder that the Lord doesn’t just want to be part of your Sundays... He longs to be part of every step you take, every dream you chase, and every thought you hold inside. He is not distant from you; He is reaching for you, waiting for you to invite Him into all that you are and all that you do. <br/><br/>
The truth is, He delights in you. He formed you with care, and His Spirit yearns to guide you into joy that no one can take away. When you welcome Him into your heart in the small daily things..in your smile, your work, your rest, your prayers...He wraps your life with a peace and strength that the world cannot touch. <br/><br/>
Never forget, Ms Sunshine, the Savior doesn’t only want to save you...He wants to walk beside you, laugh with you, comfort you, and lift you higher than you ever imagined. You are sought after by Heaven, and that makes your life infinitely precious. <br/><br/>
Be safe, be happy, and know I’m always here for you...forever. 💛

      <p class="queen-caption hidden"> Catriona Gray, Miss Universe 2018, is more than just a beauty queen.. she’s a voice for children’s education, HIV/AIDS awareness, and spreading kindness wherever she goes.

She once said, “When you see someone’s difficulties, do not look at them with pity, but instead with the intention to help.” That’s real beauty...when your heart is as powerful as your presence.

🌸 Just like Catriona, you Ms Sunshine have the same spark..the mix of grace, strength, and a voice that can move people. Don’t ever doubt how far your light can shine.      . ✨ </p>
