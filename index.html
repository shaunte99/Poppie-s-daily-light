  <p class="message" id="love-note">
   Hey Ms Sunshine, <br/><br/>
The Sabbath is a holy reminder that the Lord doesn’t just want to be part of your Sundays... He longs to be part of every step you take, every dream you chase, and every thought you hold inside. He is not distant from you; He is reaching for you, waiting for you to invite Him into all that you are and all that you do. <br/><br/>
The truth is, He delights in you. He formed you with care, and His Spirit yearns to guide you into joy that no one can take away. When you welcome Him into your heart in the small daily things..in your smile, your work, your rest, your prayers...He wraps your life with a peace and strength that the world cannot touch. <br/><br/>
Never forget, Ms Sunshine, the Savior doesn’t only want to save you...He wants to walk beside you, laugh with you, comfort you, and lift you higher than you ever imagined. You are sought after by Heaven, and that makes your life infinitely precious. <br/><br/>
Be safe, be happy, and know I’m always here for you...forever. 💛

      <p class="queen-caption hidden"> Mia Le Roux, Miss South Africa 2024.. someone who, just like you, walks closely with the Lord while chasing her dreams. Mia’s faith has been at the center of her journey. She leans on the Lord in every decision, every challenge, and every moment of her crown, letting Him guide her steps and shape her purpose.

What’s beautiful is that she hasn’t hidden her faith; instead, she’s allowed it to shine through her platform, inspiring others through service, love, and intentional living. Ms Sunshine, I see the same light in you — the same potential to reflect Christ in all that you do, to inspire, to lead, and to serve others while staying true to your faith and dreams.

Keep shining, keep walking with Him, and know that your journey is already a beacon for others. ✨ </p>
