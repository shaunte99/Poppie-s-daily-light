  Hey Ms Sunshine,❤️<br/><br/>

I’ll be honest with you... writing you a message every day should be a tough task, but you make it unbelievably easy just by being you. Every time I think of you, words naturally find their way out of me, because you carry something rare, something that demands to be noticed. Your presence is more than just beautiful — it’s striking, it’s spiritual. It’s like when you walk into a room, the air changes. There’s a certain gravity about you, something that draws people in without them even realizing why. And I know exactly why..it’s built on your heart, on your humility, on your beauty that goes deeper than the surface. It’s not something taught, not something practiced, it’s something God-given.<br/><br/>

I say all this to tell you something simple, but something I don’t ever want you to forget: you are one in a million. You’re special in a way that doesn’t just blend in with the world — you were meant to stand out, to change it, to leave people a little different after meeting you. You are purpose wrapped in grace, a different kind of angel walking through everyday life, and I feel lucky just to witness it<br/><br/>

 Life gets hectic for all of us, and I know that sometimes it feels heavy, like it’s pulling us in every direction. But one thing you should always know, even on the hardest days, is that I would do anything for you. I’d stand with you in the storm, I’d show up for you when you least expect it, and I’d be there in the ways that matter most... because you mean the world to me. And no matter how crazy life gets, I’ll always have your back. Always.❤️ <br/><br/>
