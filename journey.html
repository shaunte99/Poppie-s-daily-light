      <h2>January 2024</h2>
      <p>There was a specific day in January when we started being friends, and you told me your dreams of pageantry and what it means to you.  
      You wanted to start by entering your high school pageant .. something you always wanted to do .. and I believed you were going to do great.</p>

      <p>Two months passed and you trusted me enough to share your concerns about the pageant.  
      There were moments you panicked if your walk or dance was enough, and tough competition made you nervous.  
      But you were confident you'd win Miss Personality because so many loved that about you.</p>

      <p>In my heart, I knew you'd win the whole thing because your beauty inside and out was undeniable.  
      Maybe you didnâ€™t know, or I never told you, but I prayed hard for the Lord to help you win .. because I knew you had it in you.</p>

      <p>Here comes the big day in May! But like all days that matter, it started with hiccups â€” trouble with hair and makeup.  
      You made it through in time, thanks to your amazing mother.</p>

      <p>I remember sitting there with your mom when the lights went off and you started dancing â€” the crowd went wild!  
      <a href="#" class="video-link" data-video-src="videos/dancing-video.mp4">Watch the moment</a></p>

      <p>There you were, front and center, dancing your heart out .. thatâ€™s when I knew you were winning.</p>

      <p>You killed it the whole night, winning over the judges.  
      You went on to win the whole thing .. I was so happy for you because you truly deserved to be Queen.</p>

      <p>Thatâ€™s the day Cherise saw you and was impressed, encouraging you to enter another pageant.</p>

      <p>You told me you had your plate full and werenâ€™t sure if you could do it .. but after thinking hard, you entered.</p>

      <p>This journey was different .. a year-long campaign full of challenges, but in true Poppie fashion,  
      you pulled through because of Heavenly Fatherâ€™s love, guiding every step.</p>

      <p>One challenge was selling charity balls for a little girl with leukemia .. it was hard, but you made it happen.  
      You also faced other charity challenges but managed to do your best every time.</p>

      <p>I was so proud that night .. I kept looking backstage for you.  
      There you were, happy and emotional watching your mentor take her last walk before you were crowned.  
      To me, that said this is exactly what you want and what youâ€™re destined to be.</p>
