  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️<br><br>Hey Ms Sunshine Happy Monday ..I hope your day treated you real good. I hope you smiled, breathed a little deeper, and did at least one thing today that reminded you of you.. something dope ...I can’t lie, I don’t usually love Mondays… but for you? I do. Because you finally get to slow down a bit and rest from all the nonstop grind... And that makes the day feel different you know. I Just wanted to say as always I’m proud of you ..like every day. And not a day goes by where I don’t ask God to cover you in love, peace, and protection. So yeah… I hope today was wonderful. You deserve that and more 💛."
