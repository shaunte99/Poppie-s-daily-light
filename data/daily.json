  "message": "Hey Ms Sunshine ☀️💛<br><br>I just hope today’s been good to you even if it’s been slow, simple, or busy. Sundays don’t always need to be perfect… but I do hope you felt a little more peace, a little more light, and maybe even a reason to smile.<br><br>So today, I just wanted to remind you of Something and that's you don’t have to try so hard to be special. You already are. Your presence is enough. Your heart is enough. You just being you is more than enough.<br><br>Take a deep breath tonight. Let go of the pressure. And let yourself feel proud not for what you got done Today, but for how far you’ve come and how you’ve kept going. That’s worth celebrating, always.<br><br>Have a restful night, Ms Sunshine. Tomorrow can wait. Right now, just be proud of today. You mean the world to me and I'm very proud of you 💛"
