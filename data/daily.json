I pray that your thoughts stay clear, your heart stays soft, and that you always feel protected in every space you walk into. Prayer isnâ€™t just a routine ..itâ€™s your armor, your power in a noisy world.<br><br>I truly believe that peace and prayer will carry you to your dreams... You have everything it takes ..the strength, the softness, the brilliance, and the Everything else. And when you walk hand in hand with God, nothing can stand in your way.
