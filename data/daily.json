You *wrote* yours.<br><br>With every task, every small decision, every small win ... you stitched intention into ordinary days, and turned them into something rare...<br><br>You move like someone who doesnâ€™t need to announce their presence to make it felt...The kind of elegance in the way you do the work you do, keep your head up, and still find space to be the amazing person you are.<br><br>This space? It exists because of you... Your spark. Everything around it just rises to meet the energy and beauty you bring.<br><br>So hereâ€™s to your week... and to the woman behind it all. The Reason why, The Sun in human form... The masterpiece in progress And The one I'm so proud of ðŸ’›."
