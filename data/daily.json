  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️<br><br>I just want you to pause and remember how rare your soul is. The kindness you carry. The light in your smile. The strength behind your gentle heart. It's all noticed ...<br><br>There's a scripture that says God rejoices over you with singing. Imagine that... the Creator of the stars singing just because *you* exist. That’s how treasured you are. 💐<br><br>So breathe deep today. Keep glowing, even when it's quiet. You're not just seen ...you're deeply, beautifully *loved*.<br><br>Always rooting for you 🦋💛"
