  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️<br><br>I know today may have been heavy Or a little bit easier. The world asks so much of you .your smile, your strength, your grace. But here, in this space, I want you to put all that down.

You don’t need to prove anything here. You don’t need to impress or pretend. Just breathe. Let your shoulders drop. Let your soul be held.

I made this site so even when I can't physically tell how proud i am of you, you’ll feel me. Cheering you on. Praying for you.

I’m so proud of the woman you are. The way you love people. The way you serve, even when you're tired.

Tonight, rest knowing that you are not alone. You are deeply, fiercely, beautifully loved.

Sleep peacefully, Ms Sunshine. Tomorrow’s light will be brighter — and I’ll still be here.

Always,"
