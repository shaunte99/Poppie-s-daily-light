  "message": "Hey Ms Sunshine ☀️💖<br><br>I hope today gave you at least one reason to smile because that smile of yours? It’s the reason the world feels beautiful for a couple of hours, like the sun decided to shine just a little longer.<br><br>Whether today was Good, Bad, or somewhere in between, I just want you to know something simple but true:<br><br>I’ll always be here for you.No matter what, no matter when. You’re never alone.. not on the hard days, not even in the quiet ones.<br><br>And more than anything, I hope you know how proud I am of you. Every step you take, every bit of effort you give I see it. God sees it. And it matters.<br><br>You’ve got something rare in you. Please don’t forget it Ms sunshine..You mean the world to me"
