And I mean it with every part of my heart... because you matter to me that deeply. You mean more to me than words can really hold.<br><br>The world can be so cruel. So unfair. So cold. But somehow, God placed someone like you right in the middle of it. A rare soul...You are one in a million and not just to me, but to everyone lucky enough to know you.<br><br>You are special. To your family. To your friends. To Heavenly Father. But most especially... to me. I see it when you smile, when you laugh, when you do everything in your power to pursue your dreams. You have something the world desperately needs. And I thank God often for bringing someone like you into my life.<br><br>He is your protector, always. The One who fights for you even when you‚Äôre unaware.. You don‚Äôt walk alone. And when life gets messy, remember that the Lord has already gone before you, making the crooked paths straight. You are His beloved daughter. And no battle you face is ever faced alone.<br><br>I care for you Ms sunshine.And I‚Äôm here cheering for your joy, your safety, and your dreams."
