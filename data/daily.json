You carry light even on your hard days — and I see that. I hope today reminded you of your strength, your softness, and your deep purpose. Keep leaning into prayer, into grace, and into joy. I believe in you, and I pray that tonight your soul rests in stillness and comfort. Always cheering for you, always proud of you 💙💙"
