  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️<br><br>I don’t know exactly how your week unfolded I would love to know… Maybe you laughed till your stomach hurt. Maybe you held back tears because no one could really tell how much you were doing But today ...this moment ..is just for you. I hope you pause long enough to let this sink in Ms sunshine ..You are God’s masterpiece ..handpicked, purposefully placed, and deeply known. He sees the version of you that no one else sees… and still calls you worthy, over and over again. And me? I see you too ..whether it will be messy moments and your magical ones. In your tired eyes and your unspoken prayers. And honestly… I care about all of you.I hope You know you are more than strong .. You're softness that survives, Grace that keeps showing up, Beauty that doesn’t even try, Faith stitched into skin. When the world gets heavy, I want these words to meet you Halfway..You mean the world to me and You’re doing better than you think. You are never alone. And the sunlight you carry ..it's not going out. Ever. If the tears come, let them. I’ll always offer to be the softest place to land for you, the warmest sleeve to cry on. The one who sees the whole of you and still say, I’ve got your back. You’re not just someone I care about. You are a once-in-a-lifetime soul. And I will never stop cheering for you.",
