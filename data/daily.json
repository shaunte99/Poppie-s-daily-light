  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️<br><br>I don’t know how your week unfolded… Maybe you laughed till your stomach hurt. Maybe you held back tears because no one could really tell how much you were carrying. But today — this moment — is just for you. I hope you pause long enough to let this sink in: You are God’s masterpiece — handpicked, purposefully placed, and deeply known. He sees the version of you that no one else sees… and still calls you worthy, over and over again. And me? I see you too — in your messy moments and your magical ones. In your tired eyes and your unspoken prayers. And honestly… there’s no version of you that I don’t love. You are more than strong — You're softness that survives, Grace that keeps showing up, Beauty that doesn’t even try, Faith stitched into skin. When the world gets heavy, I want these words to meet you like a warm hug: You’re doing better than you think. You are never alone. And the light you carry — it's not going out. Ever. If the tears come, let them. I’ll always be the softest place to land, the warmest sleeve to cry on. The one who sees the whole of you and still whispers, “I’ve got you.” You’re not just someone I care about. You are a once-in-a-lifetime soul. And I will never stop cheering for you."
