  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️💗<br><br>Your smile is not just beautiful.... it's healing...It’s the kind of thing that could shift a whole room, lift a heavy heart, or make someone believe in gentleness again. <br><br>That’s why I always tell you I hope you smile each day...because your smile is proof that you’re still choosing To show it in a hard world. And that means everything.<br><br>I think the world is better just because you're in it..<br><br>Your smile reminds me that beauty isn’t about perfection... it's about presence. It’s the echo of your spirit speaking before your words even do.<br><br>Never let the world steal that Smile... Never forget what your smile means..to me, and to this world.<br><br>You mean the world to me. And I’m proud of you. Always.💗"
