  "message": "Ms Sunshine ☀️<br><br>Some days, you’re going to feel like you’ve given all you’ve got and it still won’t feel enough.But listen… it was never your job to be everything for everyone.You’re not weak for needing rest sometimes... You’re not behind for feeling tired.Even the strongest people crumble sometimes and even then, Jesus leans in close and stays.He doesn’t love the version of you that’s crushing goals.He loves the undone, exhausted version too.The one who’s just trying.And I promise you…You don’t have to pretend.Not with Him. Not with me.You're held even when you feel like you're falling.Let that truth wrap around you tonight like a soft blanket."
