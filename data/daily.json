  "message": "Hey Ms sunshine🩷<br><br>Just wanted to say something simple tonight: you're genuinely such a beautiful person ... in how you speak, how you move, and how you just are.<br><br>You don’t have to try hard to be impressive. You just are.<br><br>God’s love for you? It’s real. Always has been. *“I have loved you with an everlasting love.”* That kind of love sticks. It doesn’t fade or change and honestly, it makes sense… because someone like you? You’re one of one.<br><br>I hope your Monday felt good. And even if it was just a regular day, I hope you feel how appreciated you are. You deserve to feel safe, valued, and at peace . As always I am proud of you 🦋"
