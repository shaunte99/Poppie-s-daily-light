The Lord your Creator has wrapped you in His promises.. and even when the winds blow very strong.. you stand. Not by chance but by design.<br><br>He walks ahead of you in battles you never see. He holds your heart when you too tired to speak. You Ms sunshine are never alone .. the King of Heaven calls you His.<br><br>Like sunlight slipping through clouds, your sunlight breaks through with power. You shine not because life is perfect but because God is present in you. You are protected ..not by walls but by the Word. Not by fear, but by faith.<br><br>And when the days feel heavy when you wonder if you really enough, I hope you feel this truth that You are deeply loved by the One who made the stars ..and He made you just as carefully.<br><br>Ms Sunshine I care for you more than I know how to say. I admire the woman you are ..soft yet fierce, graceful yet grounded.Your soul inspires me.<br><br>I thank God that you exist daily Always in your corner.. Always proud. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
