  "message": "Hey there Ms. Sunshine ☀️💛<br><br>I prayed for you Last night... Not just for your protection in the typical way, but in every layer of what safety really means for you... I pray for your joy to be guarded. For your smile to have constant reasons to show up... For your peace to sit quietly beside you, even when life gets chaotic.<br><br>Safety, for you, is so much more than physical... it’s emotional steadiness, spiritual alignment, and daily reminders that you're loved by Heavenly Father... And I trust God with every bit of your heart, because His love never stops pursuing you.<br><br>You're doing more than you realize... You’re walking through each season like you were made for it.. and truthfully, you are. I see that. I honor it.<br><br>I’m proud of you as always. And as always you mean the world to me💖"
