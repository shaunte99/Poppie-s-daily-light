The kind of happy that's not forced but the one that grows from peace... joy that no one can take away because it lives deep in your spirit.<br><br>You are the most precious thing in this world to me. Please never forget that.<br><br>No matter what you’re facing, what you’re feeling, or how messy life gets... I’ll be here. Cheering for you. Covering you in prayer. Holding space for you<br><br>You were born to light this world up. And I will always, always believe in you. 💗"
