  "message": "Hey Ms Sunshine üåû<br><br>Tonight i wanna say that You ever notice how even on cloudy days the sun still rises? That can be applied you.. You don‚Äôt need perfect conditions to shine because your presence alone shifts the whole room. You don‚Äôt need to try too hard... just smiling is enough to pour peace into the world‚Äôs chaos.<br><br>Your laugh, your kindness, even your quietness it all carries Heavenly father's fingerprints. And when life gets busy Ms sunshine I hope you never forget that the reason things feel lighter when you around is because you were made to be light.. Simple. <br><br>God didn‚Äôt just make you beautiful He made you impactful... You move people. You move me. <br><br>And maybe you don‚Äôt always see it but I do. Every single day. That spark in you? That warmth? It‚Äôs not common. It's not random. Its the lord saying The world needs her.<br><br>You're not just someone I care about you are someone I admire deeply.and i deeply mean that.<br><br>So tonight I hope you rest knowing that you are cared for <br><br> I‚Äôm proud of you. Always. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
