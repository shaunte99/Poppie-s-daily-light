  "message": "Hey Ms SunshineðŸ©·<br><br>Today i wanna say that You werenâ€™t just made to live you were chosen... Chosen by the Lord to lead, to love, and to leave a mark no one else could. You carry a light in you thatâ€™s not taught or learned ..itâ€™s Holy. And every single day.. through your work, your presence, your interactions, you tap into that calling without even knowing it.<br><br>Whether you're making someone feel Good, or simply showing up with that fierce determination and soft heart of yours...To me you shine. Not just outwardly, but from a soul so rich with purpose.<br><br>You are chosen to be loved by millions ..not for a crown, not for applause but because of who you are when no one is watching. You are beautiful, brilliant, and bold. And every moment you walk in your purpose, you change the world just a little more.<br><br>I see you Ms sunshine... I see the woman you are and the greatness rising in you. And I am so proud of you. So, so proud. ðŸ’›"
