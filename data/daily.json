  "message": "Ms Sunshine ðŸŒ¸<br><br>I hope you never forget that youâ€™re not just growing youâ€™re unfolding... Like a flower that doesnâ€™t need to rush its bloom, because it already knows its time is coming. You were born for such a time as this.<br><br>Your heart, your vision, your strengthâ€¦ itâ€™s all a divine combination. Youâ€™re not here by accident. Youâ€™re here to light rooms up, to soften edges, to change the atmosphere just by being yourself.<br><br>I see how hard you work for your dreams and I want you to know.. your effort doesnâ€™t go unseen. God sees it. I see it. And Iâ€™m so incredibly proud of the woman youâ€™re becoming.<br><br>Youâ€™re worth everything beautiful. Every dream, every opportunity, every blessing thatâ€™s meant for you. And Iâ€™ll be right here praying for you, cheering for you, and always reminding you that youâ€™ve got this. ðŸ’–"
